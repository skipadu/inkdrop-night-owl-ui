```
ipm install night-owl-dark-ui
```

## Do you want to have full Night Owl package?

```
ipm install night-owl-preview
ipm install night-owl-syntax
```

## Notes

- Could not do exact match versus the VSCode when comparing same file. CodeMirror does not chop all text to enough small pieces that those could be added their own style.
- Light version of the theme (Light Owl), is not yet implemented.
