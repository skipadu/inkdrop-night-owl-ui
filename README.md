# Night Owl'ish UI Theme for Inkdrop

- UI theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.info/).
- Ported [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) by Sarah Drasner
- Modified from the [Inkdrop's default dark UI theme](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-default-dark-ui-theme)

## Notes

Could not do exact match versus the VSCode when comparing same file. CodeMirror does not chop all text to enough small pieces that those could be added their own style.
