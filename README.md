# Night Owl'ish UI Theme for Inkdrop

- UI theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.info/).
- Based on VSCode theme, [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) by Sarah Drasner

## Notes

- Could not do exact match versus the VSCode when comparing same file. CodeMirror does not chop all text to enough small pieces that those could be added their own style.
- Light version of the theme (Light Owl), is not yet implemented.
